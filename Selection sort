What is Selection Sort?

Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm.
It works by repeatedly finding the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part of the array and putting it in the correct position.

ðŸ”¹ Steps of Selection Sort:
Start with the first element.
Find the smallest element in the array.
Swap it with the first element.
Move to the next position and repeat until the array is sorted.

ðŸ”¹ Example:
Suppose we have an array:
[64, 25, 12, 22, 11]
Pass 1 â†’ Smallest is 11, swap with first â†’ [11, 25, 12, 22, 64]
Pass 2 â†’ Smallest in remaining part is 12, swap with 25 â†’ [11, 12, 25, 22, 64]
Pass 3 â†’ Smallest is 22, swap with 25 â†’ [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
Pass 4 â†’ Already sorted.

âœ… Final sorted array: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]


public class SelectionSort {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {64, 25, 12, 22, 11};

        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
            int minIndex = i; // assume current index is smallest
            for (int j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
                if (arr[j] < arr[minIndex]) {
                    minIndex = j; // update min index
                }
            }
            // swap arr[i] and arr[minIndex]
            int temp = arr[i];
            arr[i] = arr[minIndex];
            arr[minIndex] = temp;
        }

        // Print sorted array
        System.out.print("Sorted array: ");
        for (int num : arr) {
            System.out.print(num + " ");
        }
    }
}
